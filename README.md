Twitolu
=======

I created this app to help me organize, visualize and socialize my Twitter feed.


I have used Twitter since it first became available to the public. 
I like the medium of microblogging to quickly create snippets of the cool things I see online every day.
However, there aren't many tools that allow you to look back through history to remind you what you were thinking about last week.
